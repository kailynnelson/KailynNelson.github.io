			<h1>Case study: Design for returns disruption</h1>
			<h2>
				I helped the worldâ€™s leading brands to recover more value from their
				returned items.
			</h2>
			<p>
				The mission of Trove, an innovative circular commerce logistics startup,
				is to extend the lifespan of high-quality gear and apparel by operating
				profitable trade-in and resale programs at scale for top outdoor and
				luxury brands like Patagonia, lululemon, and Gucci. I joined the company
				in June 2022 to design the user experience (UX) and user interfaces
				(UIs) for their warehouse operations software products.
			</p>
			<p>
				In November 2022, a market opportunity arose to disrupt returns
				management. A cross-functional team was assembled, inclusive of business
				leaders, warehouse operations experts, engineers and architects, and me,
				the product designer. My purpose in this team was to deliver a lean,
				vetted, and feasible design prototype in a high-stakes, fast-paced
				environment so that our team could test the market as quickly and
				thoughtfully as possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the story of how I used the power of design thinking and
				artifacts to navigate through ambiguity, drive stakeholder alignment,
				and deliver a crystal-clear user experience for our pilot.
			</p>
